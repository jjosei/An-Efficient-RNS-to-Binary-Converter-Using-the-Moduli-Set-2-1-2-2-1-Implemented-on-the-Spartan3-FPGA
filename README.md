- VHDL Implementation: Fully coded in VHDL, ready for synthesis and simulation on FPGA platforms.<br>

# Project Structure
- Contains the VHDL source code for the RNS to Binary converter.<br>
- Includes simulation files and testbenches for validating the functionality of the converter.<br>
- Documentation detailing the design, implementation, and theoretical background.<br>

# Getting Started
Prerequisites<br>
- VHDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL)<br>
- FPGA development environment (e.g., Xilinx ISE, Vivado)<br>

# Technical Details
- Modified Chinese Remainder Theorem<br>
Our approach leverages a modified version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which includes:<br>

- Pseudo SRT Division: An efficient division algorithm that simplifies the conversion process.<br>
- Weighted Representation: Enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the CRT-based conversion.<br>
- These modifications result in a more efficient conversion process, reducing both computational complexity and resource usage compared to traditional CRT methods.
